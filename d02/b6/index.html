  <h2>React Blog 123</h2>
  <p>This blog is the official source for the updates from the React team. Anything important,
    including release notes or deprecation notices, will be posted here first. You can also
    follow the <a href="#" class="first">@reactjs</a> account on Twitter, but you won't miss anything essential if you
    only
    read this blog.</p>

    <p class="Year">May 3, 2023</p>
    <p>Traditionally, new React features used to only be available at Meta first, and land in the open
      source releases later. We'd like to offer the React community an option to adopt individual new
      features as soon as their design is close to finalâ€”similar to how Meta uses React internally. We
      are introducing a new officially supported Canary release channel. It lets curated setups like
      frameworks decouple adoption of individual React features from the React release schedule.</p>
